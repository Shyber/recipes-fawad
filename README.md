# Introduction

My go-to stack is React-TypeScript-MobX using the Material-UI framework. (Check out [Mobx](https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx)).

However, this sample clearly mentioned the use of Redux for state management and Thunk, so I avoided MobX and even Typescript. However, I stuck with Material UI for UI needs.

Over time, I've created my own vanilla boiler plate for projects at Evolve, which just get updated and used from one project to another. Therefore, I looked around for a well crafted boiler-plate instead of starting from scratch and then made the necessary changes.

What I used:

* âš› React â€” 16.8.6
* â™» Redux with Redux Thunk â€” State Management with middleware to handle async requests
* ðŸ›  Babel â€” ES6 syntax, Airbnb & React/Recommended config
* ðŸš€ Webpack â€” Hot Reloading, Code Splitting, Optimized Build
* ðŸ’… UI/CSS â€” [Material-UI] (https://material-ui.com/)
* âœ… Tests â€” Jest, React Testing Library 
* ðŸ’– Lint â€” ESlint

Heavily inspired from [React-BOLT] (https://github.com/leonardomso/react-bolt)

Commands:

* Lint: yarn lint
* Test: yarn test
* Debug: yarn start
* Build: yarn build
